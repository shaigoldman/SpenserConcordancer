# SpenserConcordancer

Generates a [concordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(publishing)) for the works of the poet Edmund Spenser. As of now, I only have it reading the six books of the Faery Queene; perhaps future works will be added later. The generated concordance can be read as a txt file named "concordance.txt".
It also creates .json files interpreted by my web app, found [here](https://github.com/shaigoldman/spenser-concordance-app).

Created using the source texts found at https://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/fqintro.html.
